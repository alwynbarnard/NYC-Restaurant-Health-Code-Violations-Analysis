# Analysis of NYC Restaurant Health Code Violations (2023)
Using Python and Power BI, I conducted a data-driven investigation of New York City's restaurant health inspection data to identify patterns in violations and assess food safety compliance across the city's diverse dining landscape.
Key Components:

Cleaned and preprocessed extensive health inspection records using Python, addressing inconsistencies and standardizing violation codes
Developed interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize violation patterns and geographic distributions
Analyzed temporal trends in violation frequencies and severity levels
Mapped correlation between restaurant characteristics and inspection outcomes

Tools & Technologies:

Python (pandas, numpy) for data cleaning and statistical analysis
Power BI for visualization and interactive reporting
SQL for database management and query optimization

The project provided valuable insights into food safety patterns across NYC's restaurant industry, highlighting areas for targeted intervention and policy improvement. The analysis helped identify systemic issues and temporal patterns in health code compliance.
